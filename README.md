My Sonic Pi projects

Sonic Pi is 'the live coding synth for everyone' - a great bit of software written by Sam Aaron. It's designed to encourage children and adults to make music while learning the principles of coding. It's so easy to use, even this old fool can make noises with it!

I first discovered it on my Raspberry Pi Linux distro, but it is also available in open-source Windows and Mac flavours at:
http://sonic-pi.net/

I've already made a few poor quality bits of noise using Sonic Pi, with Audacity for external samples and mixing. These are on my Soundcloud page - search there for Patrick Martin 48 if you can be bothered. But Sam is rightly keen that users should share their Sonic Pi code as much as possible, so I'll try and post here anything that doesn't rely on external samples. If you can get my code to work, I'd appreciate any feedback; but since I'm new to both coding and composition, please be gentle with me!

Cheers,

Patrick Martin
